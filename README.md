# NRI Future Risk

[Visit Tool](https://fulton-ring.github.io/nri-future-risk/)

This tool is a replica of the National Risk Index (NRI) Future Risk tool, which
was removed from the public by the US Government in February, 2025. It
references the following datasets which were downloaded before the tool was
taken down:

- [NRI Future Risk Master Datasheet](https://github.com/fulton-ring/nri-future-risk/tree/main/public/nri-future-risk/NRI_Future_Risk_Master_Datasheet_12052024.xlsx)

## Architecture

This tool is built using React and Leaflet. We use Vite
as the bundler.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Running Locally

To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the tool in your default browser.

## Hosting

To reduce the risk of this tool being taken down again, we recommend forking
this repository and hosting it with GitHub Pages. It currently has all the code
needed to deploy to GitHub Pages, you'll just need to enable GitHub Pages in
your fork's repository settings.

More deployment guides to come as needed.
